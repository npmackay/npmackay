👋 Hi, I’m @npmackay

👀 Passionate about programming and software development, I'm always eager to learn and expand my knowledge in the field.

🌱 Currently enrolled at St. Lawrence College, I'm actively exploring various technologies including C++, HTML/CSS/JS, SQL/PHP/COBOL, and JAVA.

💰 Currently, I am gaining valuable experience as an intern Front End Developer at MyLaminin. Working with the MERN stack, I'm contributing to the development of exciting projects.

💞️ I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on diverse projects that can help me expand my skill set and knowledge. I'm open to any opportunity that can teach me at least one new thing.
